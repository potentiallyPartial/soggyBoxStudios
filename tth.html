    <h2>Through the Night, Fire side game Jam</h2>
    Through the Night is a game jam game that I produced entirely by myself. <br><br> 
For those who do not know, game jams are events where individuals, or teams of developers build a themed 
game with certain restrictions within a set amount of time. <br><br>
This was my first ever attempt at game development. I think this is a cool thing to include as it is a 
project where I went from zero experience in this topic to a serviceable game in one week. <br><br>
I built this in Godot using the native GdScript which is a java like language native to the engine. 
All the assets were also made by me in a free illustrating program as well as a combination of freely 
available sound assets and home made audio files. <br><br> 
This project was my first attempt at developing something with a solid time constraint and I learned a 
lot about managing the entire process from conceptualization to polishing. <br>
The Game can be played <a href="https://caninblue.itch.io/through-the-night">Here!</a>
