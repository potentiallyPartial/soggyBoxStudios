    <h2>BJ's Party House Intake Form Project.</h2>
    Bjâ€™s party house is a performer troupe that operates in the Tallahassee area. 
    I got involved during an assignment where we needed to help the owners update some of their It systems.<br><br>
     During the lifetime of this project my group overhauled both the social media front for the business
      as well as the customer intake form on their web page.<br><br> My main job was to handle the implementation 
      of this entire form as my other group mates needed to focus on the social media overhaul. <br><br>Before the
     project the intake form was just a single text field with a submit button. Over the course of the 
    project I designed the page, set up the text fields to properly populate and exclude invalid options.<br><br>
     Lastly the entire project was set up to export and format the output to a PDF that could be used as
     a launching point for a contract.<br><br> One of my favorite features I implemented is the cost estment.
    This system was set up by using the number of guests, time for the event, and the type and number
     of performers to show a live updating cost estment at the bottom of the form.
